# NaiveBayes_IRIS

This study focuses on classification and analysis performed on the Iris dataset using the Naive Bayes classification algorithm. The main objective is to evaluate the performance of the Naive Bayes algorithm and demonstrate how classification processes are carried out.

DATASET AND PREPROCESSING

Iris Dataset:

SepalLengthCm: Sepal length (cm)

SepalWidthCm: Sepal width (cm)

PetalLengthCm: Petal length (cm)

PetalWidthCm: Petal width (cm)

Species: Species name (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

The dataset consists of 150 samples, each containing the features listed above.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Unnecessary columns were removed.

Missing values were checked and cleaned.

The data was divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

NAIVE BAYES ALGORITHM

Theoretical Background:
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayesâ€™ theorem. It calculates the prior probabilities of each class and uses probability density functions under the assumption of normal distribution to estimate class likelihoods.

Implementation:
The study demonstrates, step by step, how the Naive Bayes algorithm is implemented, including code snippets and explanations of the classification process.

MODEL TRAINING AND TESTING

Training Data: 70% of the data was used for training, and 30% for testing.

Model Training: The model was trained using the training dataset.

Prediction and Evaluation: Predictions were made on the test dataset, and model performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics.
